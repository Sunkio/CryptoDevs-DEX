# CryptoDevs DEX
A simple decentralized exchange with only one asset pair (CryptoDevs Token/ETH) for the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) blockchain. The DEX is a simple contract that allows users to buy and sell tokens. The tokens are then distributed to the users. The DEX contract is based on the [Token]().

## Description
Basic built that is modeled after Uniswap's V1, this DEX is a simple contract that allows users to buy and sell tokens. The tokens are then distributed to the users. The DEX contract is based on the [Token]().
It takes a fee of 1% on swaps. When users add liquidity, they get CryptoDev LP tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens). These tokens can be used to remove liquidity from the pool.
CryptoDevs LP tokens are given proportional to the Ether a user is willing to add to the liquidity.
